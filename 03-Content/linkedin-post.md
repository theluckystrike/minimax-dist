🚀 Just released: Chrome Extension Starter MV3

After building 18 Chrome extensions used by 50K+ developers, I learned one thing:

Starting from scratch is the worst part.

So I built a starter that handles all the boilerplate:

✅ TypeScript 5.3
✅ Manifest V3 
✅ Hot reload
✅ Analytics ready
✅ Production builds

One command to start:
`npx degit zovo-tools/chrome-extension-starter-mv3 my-extension`

No more:
- Setting up Webpack
- Figuring out MV3 permissions
- Adding service worker boilerplate
- Configuring Chrome.storage

The Chrome extension ecosystem is exploding. With Manifest V2 dying, there's never been a better time to build.
