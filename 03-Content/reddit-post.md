title: "I built a Chrome Extension Starter after making 18 extensions"

body:
I've been building Chrome extensions for years (18 in the Web Store). Every time I started a new one, I copied the same boilerplate. Manifest V3 made this worse.

So I built a starter: https://github.com/zovo-tools/chrome-extension-starter-mv3

Features:
- Manifest V3 out of the box
- TypeScript
- Hot reload
- Service worker examples
- Storage utilities

Would love feedback!
