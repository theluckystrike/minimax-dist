1/ I just published @zovo/extension-starter — a Chrome extension starter that would've saved me hundreds of hours. Here's what it does 🧵

2/ The problem: Manifest V3 docs are scattered, best practices unclear, boilerplate every time.

3/ After building 18 Chrome extensions, I extracted everything into one starter:
- Manifest V3 ready
- TypeScript
- Hot reload
- Storage utilities

4/ Get started:
npx @zovo/extension-starter create my-ext
cd my-ext
npm run dev

5/ Built with ❤️ by @Zovo — we make Chrome extensions people actually use.

6/ Try it! https://github.com/zovo-tools/chrome-extension-starter-mv3
