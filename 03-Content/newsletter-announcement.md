## Subject: New: Production-ready Chrome Extension Starter (Manifest V3 + TypeScript)

## Body:

Hey!

Building a Chrome extension? Stop wasting time on setup.

I just released **chrome-extension-starter-mv3** - a production-ready starter that saves you hours.

### What's Inside:
- TypeScript 5.3
- Manifest V3
- Hot reload in dev
- Service worker setup
- Chrome.storage wrapper
- Analytics integration

### Get Started:
```bash
npx degit zovo-tools/chrome-extension-starter-mv3 my-extension
cd my-extension
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it. Your extension is running.

With Manifest V2 being deprecated, this is the starter you need for 2024.

Cheers,
Michael
